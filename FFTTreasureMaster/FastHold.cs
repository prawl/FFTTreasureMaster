/// Problem addressed: on running-water maps the engine animates terrain render-flag
/// bytes at ~60 fps (~16 ms), clearing the held 0x80 between the 33 ms loop's
/// re-stamps and causing visible flicker. Re-stamping at ~8 ms (≈2× per animation
/// frame) out-paces the wipe so the bit is set whenever a frame renders.

/// Concurrency: TileHolder is stateless and OR-only (it never clears bits, only
/// OR-sets 0x80 on Resting bytes via RPM/WPM). The fast thread and the 33 ms loop
/// calling Hold on the same addresses is therefore safe: concurrent OR-sets to the
/// same byte are idempotent and there is no clear path in this module.
