///     reads 1 for seconds every turn, Paused reads 0, and mid-battle dialogue reads 0 with a real
///     eventId. So a momentary out-of-live read is normal mid-combat and must NOT end the battle.
///   * the slot9 sentinel both STICKS on the post-battle world map (so it can't mark the end) and
///     can DROP mid-battle (so its loss can't mark the end either).
/// Enter fires the instant any enter signal appears; exit needs SUSTAINED out-of-live time
/// (<see cref="ExitDebounceSeconds"/>), with pause and real-event ticks SUSPENDING the timer (a
/// pause mid-world-map must not reset progress; a pause mid-battle must never accumulate). An
/// in-live tick zeroes the accumulator. The stuck-sentinel world map is sustained out-of-live, so
/// exit fires there -- giving the next battle a clean Enter + reset. Time comes only from the
/// passed-in DateTime (tests feed synthetic clocks; the machine never reads the wall clock).
